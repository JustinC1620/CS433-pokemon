# CS433 Project 3:Pokémon Game
## Description
The Goal is to create a Pokémon game using what we have learned up until this point(PHP,JavaScript,CSS,SQL,HTML,etc) 
with some additional project requirements

Our version of a Pokémon game is going to be a [roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike). Think something 
similar to [PokeRogue](https://pokerogue.net/) where items,starting Pokémon,trainers,route encounters are all randomized

## How was it made?
<!-- we can add how everything comes together in this section. Or remove it if we don't feel it to be necessary-->
## How to play
<!-- here we will add how the basic gameplay loop goes and maybe how items interact with each other -->
## Controls
<!-- add control scheme here -->

## References
<!-- add anything we used  especially if it was ripped from somewhere -->

### Audio
None of the audio used is of our own, but it made a nice addition to our project.

#### Artists/IP holders
- Final Fantasy 15 audio: Yoko Shimomura
- Pokemon:Nintendo
- Octopath Music: Yasunori Nishiki
